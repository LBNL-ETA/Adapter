# Guidelines for Contributors

The `Adapter` software is open to contributions from the coder community. 

The contributors should comply with the 
[University of California Standards of Ethical Conduct](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/1100172/EthicalValuesandConduct).

The contribution can be a bug fix, an improvement to an existing feature, or a fully new feature. If you wish to contribute any of those please follow this workflow:

1. Fork the `Adapter` repository.
1. Create a new issue using the [Adapter issue tracker](https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/Adapter/issues) which briefly describes your intended contribution.
1. Await a response from a person responsible for code maintenance.
1. Discuss whether there is a need to address this issue and ways in which the issue could be best addressed.
1. Once an agreement is reached on how to address the issue, develop the code on a new branch on your forked repository. It is highly recommended that the branch includes the `Adapter` software repo issue number for easier tracking.
1. When you are happy with your code that addresses the issue, and after you confirm that all tests are passing, create a [pull request](https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/Adapter/compare) against the `master` branch of the `Adapter` repository.
1. Notify the person that was discussing the issue with you using `@githubname` that the feature/fix/improvement is now ready for review.
1. Conduct iterations of receiving review and addressing it until the reviewer approves the PR.
1. The reviewer will then thank you and merge the PR.
1. Now you can start utilizing the updated code!

In addition, if you have questions on how to best apply the existing code for your particular purpose, you may pose those using the [Adapter issue tracker](https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/Adapter/issues).

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our open source `Adapter` repository!
